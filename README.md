# College Info AI Chatbot
This AI-based chatbot offers students personalized guidance on college admissions by leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Natural Language Processing (NLP). It provides real-time responses to queries about admission criteria, fees, placements, and campus life, ensuring accuracy and relevance. Acting as a centralized hub, it consolidates vast information into one accessible platform, empowering students to make informed decisions. Continuously learning and adapting, our chatbot streamlines the daunting search process of going through complex websites, brochures, and geographically limited info sessions, offering a seamless & intuitive experience. It simplifies the complexities of college admissions, helping students confidently navigate their educational journey and find the best-fit institution.
